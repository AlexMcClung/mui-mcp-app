# Building an app with an AI agent and a MCP tool

- Used agent mode in GitHub Copilot (free plan)
- Added the [MUI MCP tool](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/mcp/) as context
- Prompted the agent to create a frontend React app with Vite and [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)
